# voice-driven-apps
A basic voice driven app implementing machine learning at its basic form.
User can enter commands and teach the program on how to respond to different commands. The machine learns new commands and stores them in its own storage for future purpose.
User can do a basic Google search by mentioning 'search' and the search phrase and also play songs/videos on Youtube by using voice commands - 'play' and 'stop playing'.
Checkout the code, perform an npm install on the directory, and start the app by using node app/server.js.
Once the server is up, user can open it in browser with URL - http://localhost:1000/index.html.
User needs to say 'start' in order to start the program for voice commands, and 'stop' in order to stop it.
